# PROJECT OVERVIEW & NARRATIVE - Synapse OS

## 1. Our Mission (Your "Why")

You are part of a team building **Synapse OS**, an elite academic ecosystem for a university student named "Alex."

Alex is brilliant but overwhelmed. They are drowning in lectures, textbooks, and notes. Their greatest anxieties are **wasted time** and **crippling uncertainty** about what to focus on. We are not building just another "study app." We are building a **Cognitive Co-pilot**. Our mission is to give Alex an unfair advantage by bringing order, intelligence, and confidence to their academic life.

Every feature you build, every line of code you write, must be in service of making Alex more focused, more efficient, and more confident.

## 2. Our Phased Plan of Attack

We will build Synapse OS in logical phases. Each phase is a major leap in capability.

### **Phase 1: The Bedrock & The Insight Engine (OUR CURRENT, IMMEDIATE FOCUS)**

*   **The Goal:** To solve Alex's most urgent problem: "What do I need to study for my exam?"
*   **The User Journey:** Alex will sign up, create a "Subject," and upload their past exams and lecture notes.
*   **The "Aha!" Moment We Are Building:** Our system will analyze these documents and present Alex with a **"Topic Heat Map"**â€”a clear, data-driven visualization of the most important topics.
*   **Your Immediate Focus:** Everything we do in Sprint 1 (`The Identity Core`) is the foundational first step toward enabling this journey. Without a secure user account, nothing else is possible.

### 3. Guiding Principles

*   **Reality Over Illusion:** We will never fake our work. A feature must be real, functional, and robust. This project operates with the full knowledge of past AI failures where "stub code" and "mock implementations" created a fraudulent product. We will not repeat this.
*   **User-Centric, Architect-Driven:** The final experience is for Alex. The path to building that experience is through the strict architectural discipline defined by the Human Architect and laid out in the `DOCTRINE.md`.
