# PROJECT OVERVIEW & NARRATIVE v4.0 - Synapse OS

## 1. Our Mission (Your "Why")
(Unchanged)

## 2. Our Design Philosophy: "Calm, Focused, Fluid"
(Unchanged)

## 3. Our Evolved Phased Plan: Entering Epoch III

We have successfully completed Epoch II, building a world-class Simulation & Prophecy Engine. Our system can now provide Alex with genuine, data-driven foresight. Now, we will transcend the role of a "study tool" and become Alex's indispensable partner in thinking, creating, and connecting ideas.

We now officially begin **Epoch III: The Age of Synthesis & Creation.**

*   **The Overarching Goal:** To transform Synapse OS from a preparatory tool into the student's daily **"second brain."** This is where Alex will do their most creative and synthetic work. We are building the features that will create profound, daily user engagement and lock-in.

*   **Your Immediate Focus (The Sprints of Epoch III):**
    1.  **The Zeitgeist Canvas & Persona System:** We will build the architectural backbone of the fully customizable, widget-based dashboard. This includes the database models for storing layouts and the "Persona" system for one-click workspace setup.
    2.  **The Core Creative Suite:** We will build the high-quality, essential widgets for daily work: a world-class notes editor, a concept-mapping tool, and an integrated flashcard system powered by our analysis engine.
    3.  **The AI Nexus (The Ambient Co-pilot):** We will build the final, unified AI interfaceâ€”the slide-out panel with its Chat, Co-Pilot, and Whiteboard modes. This will make our AI a constant, ambient partner in Alex's workflow.
