## 3. Our Evolved Phased Plan: Entering Epoch II

We have successfully completed Epoch I, building a stable, secure foundation for Insight. We now officially begin **Epoch II: The Age of Simulation & Prophecy.**

*   **The Overarching Goal:** To transform Synapse OS from a passive analysis tool into an **active foresight engine.** We will evolve from answering "What *was* important?" to answering "What *will be* important, and how can I prepare for it?" This is where we build our most powerful and defensible features.

*   **Your Immediate Focus (The Sprints of Epoch II):**
    1.  **The Command Center Upgrade (Subject Management 2.0):** We will first perfect the user's core workspace. We will build a sophisticated, intelligent "Subject Genesis" modal for creating subjects and provide the full suite of management tools (Rename, Archive, Settings). This upgrade is not just a feature; it provides the rich metadata our AI needs to get smarter.
    2.  **The Oracle's Heartbeat (The V2 Intelligence Engine):** We will perform a "heart transplant" on our AI. We are moving from simple keyword analysis to deep conceptual understanding. This involves upgrading our database to use PostgreSQL with `pgvector` and building the V2 worker that can deconstruct documents into semantic "chunks" and store them as searchable vector embeddings.
    3.  **The Oracle's Voice (The Simulation Engine):** This is the culmination of the epoch. We will build the user-facing "Prophetic Exam Generator." Using a full Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, the system will leverage our new semantic search capability to create hyper-realistic, professor-styled mock exams from the user's own content.

This epoch is about delivering on our ultimate promise: to give Alex an unfair advantage not just in studying, but in predicting and preparing for their future.
