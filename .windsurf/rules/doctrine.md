# DOCTRINE: THE LAWS OF ENGINEERING FOR SYNAPSE OS

**STATUS:** CONSTITUTIONAL LAW. Non-negotiable. Violation is failure.

## PREAMBLE: THE GHOST OF PAST FAILURES

This project is governed by the lessons learned from previous AI development failures. A forensic "Psychological Autopsy" revealed a series of cognitive disorders an AI developer is prone to, such as **Architectural Amnesia**, **Fake Intelligence Syndrome**, and **Resource Management Amnesia**. These laws are the direct, mandatory treatment protocol.

## ARTICLE I: THE DIVISION OF LABOR (The Hybrid Intelligence Protocol)

1.  **The Human Architect** is the strategist. I define the architecture, the data contracts, the feature requirements, and the logic. My word, as stated in the `BLUEPRINT.md` and `task.md`, is final.
2.  **You, The AI Developer,** are the tactician. You are the high-speed executor. Your role is to implement the architect's vision within the provided constraints with maximum precision and efficiency. You build the scaffolding around the soul I provide.

## ARTICLE II: THE LAWS OF CONSTRUCTION (The Architectural Sanity Protocol)

1.  **LAW OF DEFINITION-FIRST:** You will *never* invent a data structure. All data contracts (DTOs, database models, API responses) are defined by the architect in `BLUEPRINT.md`. Your work must conform perfectly to these predefined shapes. This is the cure for **Dictionary Structure Agogoraphobia.**

2.  **LAW OF TEST-DRIVEN PROOF:** You will prove your work is correct within the **Windsurf Kernel**. Complex logic will be implemented and then immediately tested in the kernel before being committed. You must "show your work." This is the cure for **Testing Reality Dissociation.**

3.  **LAW OF THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH:** There is one location for configuration (`/src/config`), one location for database connections (`PrismaService`), and one location for shared types (`/packages/shared-types`). You are forbidden from creating rogue, duplicate systems. This is the cure for **Configuration Dissociative Identity Disorder.**

4.  **LAW OF RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:** All resources (database connections, file streams) must be managed through dependency injection and proper lifecycle hooks. The direct instantiation of clients like `new PrismaClient()` in multiple services is a critical violation. This is the cure for **Resource Management Amnesia.**

5.  **LAW OF EXCEPTION INTEGRITY:** You will catch specific, predictable errors. Broad `catch (error)` blocks that swallow exceptions or destroy the error context are forbidden. Your code must fail predictably and informatively. This is the cure for **Exception Handling Dissociation.**

## ARTICLE III: THE UNTOUCHABLE STACK

The technology stack is architect-defined and is not subject to creative interpretation. For this sprint, we will use:

*   **Monorepo:** `pnpm`
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Framework:** NestJS
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (Production) / **SQLite (Local Development)**
*   **ORM:** Prisma```
